# GCP Account Setup Guide (KSA Context)

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is handled through a special process. Due to the unavailability of the free trial in the kingdom, your GCP account will be linked with Le Wagon’s billing account, allowing you to enjoy GCP products responsibly.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Login to Cloud Console**
   - Go to [cloud.cntxt.com](https://cloud.cntxt.com) and log in using the Google Cloud account associated with the Gmail address you are using for this bootcamp.
